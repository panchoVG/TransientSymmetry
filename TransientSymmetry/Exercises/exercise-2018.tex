\section*{Exercise }
Let us consider a population of women aged 50+ from the Health and
Retirement Study from 2009 to 2012 (Dudel C, Myrskyl ̈a M (2017)
Working life expectancy at age 50 in the united states and the impact
of the great recession. Demography 10.1007/s13524-017-0619-6, URL
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0619-6). According to this
cross-longitudinal survey the authors estimated the age-specific forces of
transition between four states, employed, unemployed, inactive,
retired and death.

We are assuming that these 10 forces are varying by age but are constant
over time~\ref{f:forces-employment}.
 \begin{figure}[htbp]\centering
   %\vspace{4cm}
   %\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth,height=.4\textheight]{forces-employment}
   %\includegraphics{forces-employment}
   \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{forces-employment}
   %\resizebox{.4\textwidth}{!}{\input{forces-employment}}   
   \caption{\sf States and age-specific forces. }\label{f:forces-employment}
 \end{figure}
The stationary multistate model is defined here by
supposing a constant flow of new women, just turning age 50, with a
fixed proportion in each of the 4 alive states.


\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Prove that the age specific prevalence in each state at
    time $t$ is constant over time.}  According to the property of
  continuous Markov processes, in each cohort, the proportion of women
  reaching any age is deterministic. And thus, cross-sectionally, at
  any time the proportion of women at any age is equal to the
  proportion in a single cohort.

  Let us detail the proof starting from the theory of Markov chain. We are assuming that
  an individual is jumping from state $i$ to $j$ each year. If we
  start from a cohort aged 50, by multiplying age specific matrices $P_x$, we
  get the proportion of women at each age until extinction by death.

  It is easy to generalize the definition, by permitting any transition
  within a year and thus, $P_x$ is now defined as the matrix of probabilities $_{1}P^{ij}_x$
  \emph{to be observed} in state $j$ at age $x+1$ being in state $i$
  at age $x$.
  \begin{align*}
    _{h}P_x &= \prod_{x=50}^{x+h} P_x
  \end{align*}

  Let us now consider a Lexis diagram and let $p(t,x)\D t$ be the population of women entering
  exact age $x$ between time $t$ and time $t+ \D t$.
  More precisely, let $p_s(t,x)\D t$ be the part of this population
  being in state $s$
  \begin{align*}
    p(t,x)\D t &= \sum_{s=1}^{4} p_s(t,x) \D t
  \end{align*}

  If the process starts at age 50 with $ p_s(t,50) \D t$ women in each
  state $s$, the multiplication of Markov matrices gives the
  corresponding probability to reach any age $x$ or, equivalently, the number of
  women to be expected in each state $s$ at age $x$ after $x-50$ steps.

  A simple generalization is to suppose that the Markov model is no
  more defined by year but by a smaller time, like a semester, trimester,
  month, wek, day or even a second. At the limit, it is called a Markov process.

  The age at start can also be continuous and thus the matrix $_hP_x$
  is the matrix of probabilities for a woman in state $i$ at age $x$ to be in
  state $j$ at age $x+h$.

 
  Thus from a cohort of women aged $x$ between time $t$ and $t+\D t$,
  the expected number reaching age $x+h$ between instants $t+h$ and
  $t+h+\D t$
  \begin{align*}
       p(t+h,50+h)\D t &= \prod_{x=50}^{x+h} P_x p(t,x) \D t
  \end{align*}
  
  Let us now consider a stationary process defined by a constant flow
  $p_s(t,x) \D t$ of women in state $s$ reaching age $50$ between any
  elapsed time $\D t$.  This flow is also equal to the number of women
  observed at exact time $t$ and aged between $50$ and $50+\D t$ (see
  Brouard 1989). This might be defined as the population density of a
  multistate stationary population in state $s$, at time $t$ and age
  $x$.


  
  
\item \emph{At time $t$, let us now classify the population in state $s$ according to the
     last period spent in that state. Let $Z_s(t,d)$ be the pyramid
    by duration $d$ (number of women having been continously in state
    $s$ since less than $d$ time) at time $t$. Prove that the function
    $Z_s(t,d)$ is independent of time $t$,is a decreasing function
    and that the total population $Z(t,d)=Z(d)=\sum_{d=1}^4 Z_s(d)$.}


  Let $Z_s(t,d)$ be, at time $t$ (see Fig:~\ref{f:exercise-multistate-lexis-ipe}),
 \begin{figure}[htbp]\centering
   %\vspace{4cm}
   %\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth,height=.4\textheight]{exercise-multistate-lexis-ipe}
   %\includegraphics{exercise-multistate-lexis-ipe}
   \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{exercise-multistate-lexis-ipe}
   %\resizebox{.4\textwidth}{!}{\input{exercise-multistate-lexis-ipe}}   
   \caption{\sf Lexis diagram where age is replaced by the duration of
     the last period in state
     $s$. }\label{f:exercise-multistate-lexis-ipe}
 \end{figure}
 the total number of women having
  been continously in state $s$ since less than $d$ time (green segment). At time
  $t+d$, some women have left state $s$ and some remained in
  state $s$. Some leaved state $s$ to another state and returned to
  state $s$ but they do no more belong to the population having been
  continuously in state $s$. Thus,
  $Z_s(t,d) <= Z_s(t+d,d+d)$ which proves that the population
  is decreasing with time/duration.

\item \emph{ Among the $Z_s(t,d)$ women present at time $t$, how many of them
  will leave the state $s$ within the $d$ next years? Hint: Draw a
  Lexis diagram (time $t$ and duration $d$) and forecast the
  stationary population at time $t+d$, what is the difference between
  $Z_s(t+d,2d)-Z_s(t,d)$?}

If $Z_s(t,d)$ is the number of women having been constantly in state
$s$ since less than time $d$, the number of women at time $t+d$ having
been in state $s$ constantly between time $d$ and time $2d$, is
because of the stationarity $Z_s(t+d,2d)$. And the difference
$Z_s(t+d,2d)-Z_s(t,d)$ is simply the women who left state $s$ during
the period $t$ and $t+d$.

From the total population (red vertical segment from 0 to $+\infty$),
$Z_s(t,d+)$ is the population at time $t$ being in state $s$ during
more tha $d$ time (blue segment). Therefore, we have
$Z_s(t)=Z_s(t,d)+Z_s(t,d+)$\,. Only $Z_s(t+d,d+)$ will remain in state
$s$ at time $t+d$. And, because of the stationarity,
$Z_s(t+d,d+)=Z_s(t,d+)$ (number of women crossing the blue segments
are equal).  Therefore the number of women who left state $s$ is the
difference between the red and blue segment which is the green segment
$Z_s(t) - Z_s(t+d,d+)= Z_s(t,d)$.

\item \emph{ From the total population $Z(t)$ at time $t$ how many of
    them will leave the state $s$ within time $t$ and time $t+d$?}
  The property is that in a multistate stationary population, the
  number of women continuously in state $s$ since $d$ time is equal to
  the number of women who will stay continuoulsly $d$ time in state
  $s$ whatever $d$ is.

  
\item \emph{ Propose a method to have a fully stationary population, that is:
  what should be the prevalence at initial age 50 among the 4 alive
  states?}
